# Infinite Terrain Generator

This terrain generator is an experiment in dynamically re-rendering an environment as the camera moves throughout the universe. Only a small patch of terrain is rendered based on the location of the camera. However, adjacent terrain tiles are created as the camera moves to create the effect of infinite terrain. This project was created using Three.js.
